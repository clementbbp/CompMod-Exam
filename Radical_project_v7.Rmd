#What do I need to do:

1. Define Agents
  1.1 What types. Agents + info-bits
  1.2 What parameters do they have
    1.2.1 *Agents*
        Memory
            How large is memory? Parameter*
        Location in attitude space (xy coordinate)
            This is the mean of the attitudes they hold in memory
            I can make a parameter specifying how closely to the middle the population               will start
    1.2.2 *Info bit*
        Lifespan
            Should be one tick. If they are not integrated they disappear
        Location in attitude space
            Should be random, with a distribution of -1 to 1 on both axis. This will
            represent central information output. Could also be programmed with a                   certain bias, which might represent central information better.
        Trustworthiness score
            How trustworthy is the information perceived generally?
  1.3 What will they do each tick?
    1.3.1 Agents will try to integrate the infobit which is created. Success will depend
        on the information integration formula which gives a probability of being inte-
        grated. *If the info-bit is integrated, they will move closer to that info-bit in         attitude space by averaging and updating their memory*
    1.3.2 If social media is turned on, then the agents will have a probability to share
          their location in attitude space for others to integrate
    1.3.3 Info bits will disappear after one tick
    1.3.4

# 6. Output??? Mean + sd of location over time?
